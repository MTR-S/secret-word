* Secret Word is browser game using React and Typescript where you have to discover the secret word with just one hint to win and of course, wining with the most points possible!
* In this project i used React because of the called "React components" and the "React Hooks" to have more control and simplify my code. Also used Typescript to have a better control with my variables.
